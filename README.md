# CV Repository

This repository contains my CV in both English (`eng/`) and Korean (`kor/`) versions. To compile the PDFs, use `xelatex filename.tex` in the respective directories, as the templates require XeLaTeX for proper font rendering and Korean text support.

## Last update

Last updated on October 3rd, 2025. The Korean CV is outdated.

## Required Packages

The templates require the following LaTeX packages:
- `fontspec` - For custom font loading
- `kotex` - For Korean text support
- `hyperref` - For links and cross-references
- `titlesec` - For section formatting
- `xcolor` - For custom colors

Make sure you have a complete TeX distribution (TeX Live, MiKTeX, or MacTeX) with XeLaTeX support installed.

## Required Fonts

The templates use the following fonts:
- **IBM Plex Serif** - Main document font (English text)
- **Source Han Serif KR** - Korean text font

These fonts need to be installed on your system for proper rendering. You can download them from:
- IBM Plex: https://github.com/IBM/plex
- Source Han Serif: https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-han-serif
